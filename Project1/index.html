    <h2 id="header2">Ideas for HTML Websites</h2>
    <p id="para1">To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), it’s a good idea to create a website or
        two from scratch. Even a relatively simple HTML website can teach you many of its intricacies and capabilities,

        <li><b>A personal website:</b> Create a personal site that shows off your resume, work experience, interests,
            skills, and personality. This is a project you can return to and revise over time as your skills develop
        </li>
        <li><b>An informational site:</b> Pick a topic you’re in, <a href="">then code </a> up a simple website that
            teaches visitors about it.</li>
        <li><b>A small business website:</b> You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your
            area.</li>
        <li><b>A blog:</b> While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.</li>
        <li><b>A portfolio:</b> Want to show off your other creative works? Try building a portfolio, be it a photo
